/**
 * Writes the site configurations of a seed definition, once its records exist
 * and their uids are known.
 *
 * ## Why this runs after the records, and through the core's own writer
 *
 * A site cannot be written before its root page exists: `rootPageId` is the uid
 * of a page the same set creates. The set therefore names the page by the `id`
 * its scenario declares, and this class resolves that against what
 * {@see ScenarioSeeder::seed()} actually wrote. The resolved uid always wins
 * over whatever the template declares, so a template cannot point the site
 * somewhere else - that is the one value a seed set cannot delegate.
 *
 * The core's own writer is the only supported way to produce the file, reached
 * through {@see SiteConfigurationWriterInterface} because the class holding it
 * moved: TYPO3 v13 split `SiteWriter` out of `SiteConfiguration`, and on v12.4
 * the same `write()` and `writeSettings()` are still methods of
 * `SiteConfiguration` itself. Writing the file with `file_put_contents()`
 * instead would produce the same bytes and a different result - the writer is
 * what makes a freshly written configuration visible to `SiteFinder` in the
 * same PHP process, which the seeding run itself needs, see
 * {@see self::findUncoveredSiteRoots()}. How each version achieves that differs
 * as well, and the interface is where both differences are written down.
 *
 * ## What a template is
 *
 * A directory holding a `config.yaml` and optionally a `settings.yaml`, which
 * is exactly the shape of a site below the instance's `config/sites/`. A
 * template can therefore be produced by copying a working site out of an
 * instance, and it is read with the loader TYPO3 reads its own site
 * configurations with.
 *
 * What a **minimal** `config.yaml` needs is one key: `rootPageId`, and it is
 * the one key this class overwrites anyway. Everything else has a fallback -
 * `SiteConfiguration::resolveAllExistingSites()` skips a configuration whose
 * `rootPageId` is not greater than zero **without a word**, and
 * `Site::__construct()` substitutes a default `languages` entry and an empty
 * `base` for what is missing. Both hold on 12.4 and 13.4, so a template that
 * works on one version works on the other. A useful template declares `base`
 * and `languages`, because the defaults are a site on `/` in
 * "Default / en_US.UTF-8".
 *
 * `settings.yaml` holds the site settings - the values `Site::getSettings()`
 * answers with, which is where the site-local overrides of a site's settings
 * are persisted. It is separate from `config.yaml` because the backend writes
 * it separately, and it is copied verbatim when the template ships one.
 *
 * A key a core version does not know is **written anyway**: this class hands
 * the template's array to the writer and the writer dumps it, so a template
 * carrying a v13 only key such as `dependencies:` - the site sets a site pulls
 * in, which v12 has no concept of - produces the same file on both versions.
 * What differs is only what the version makes of it when reading the site back.
 *
 * There is consequently **no version difference to apply to the finished
 * array**. Where one turns up it belongs right before the `write()` call, with
 * a `@todo` naming the condition under which it goes away, because
 * configuration is the documented exception to the "split the class" rule.
 *
 * ## An identifier that already exists is refused
 *
 * The core writer's `write()` **merges**, on both supported versions: when
 * `config.yaml` already exists it loads the unprocessed file, diffs the
 * incoming configuration against the processed one and applies only the
 * modified and removed keys with `ArrayUtility::mergeRecursiveWithOverrule()`.
 * It is built for the backend site module, where the file is the source of
 * truth and the form supplies changes. Seeding a set into an instance that
 * already has a site of that identifier would therefore produce neither the
 * template nor the previous configuration but a silent hybrid of both, so this
 * class refuses instead. Deleting first is not the answer either - the core's
 * `delete()` unlinks `config.yaml` and leaves the directory and its
 * `settings.yaml` behind, and removing an instance's hand-maintained site
 * configuration is not a seeder's decision to make.
 *
 * ## Where templates may live
 *
 * The YAML loader resolves through `GeneralUtility::getFileAbsFileName()`,
 * which refuses a path outside `Environment::getProjectPath()` and
 * `Environment::getPublicPath()`. A template therefore has to sit inside the
 * project, which every package of an installation does, and which is the same
 * constraint the seed definition itself is already read under
 * ({@see \SBUERK\Seeder\Seeding\Parser\SeedDefinitionParser::parseFile()}).
 *
 * @internal Part of the seeding implementation, not public API.
