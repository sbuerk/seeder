/**
 * Writes the site configurations of a seed definition, once its records exist
 * and their uids are known.
 *
 * ## Why this runs after the records, and through `SiteWriter`
 *
 * A site cannot be written before its root page exists: `rootPageId` is the uid
 * of a page the same set creates. The set therefore names the page by the `id`
 * its scenario declares, and this class resolves that against what
 * {@see ScenarioSeeder::seed()} actually wrote. The resolved uid always wins
 * over whatever the template declares, so a template cannot point the site
 * somewhere else - that is the one value a seed set cannot delegate.
 *
 * `TYPO3\CMS\Core\Configuration\SiteWriter` is the only supported writer and a
 * container service on TYPO3 v13.4 and v14.3 alike (both register it in
 * `Core/Classes/ServiceProvider.php::getSiteWriter()` with the very same three
 * arguments), so it is injected by type and no path handling is needed here.
 * Writing the file with `file_put_contents()` instead would produce the same
 * bytes and a different result: `write()` ends with
 * `$this->eventDispatcher->dispatch(new SiteConfigurationChangedEvent(...))`,
 * and `SiteConfiguration::siteConfigurationChanged()` and
 * `SiteFinder::siteConfigurationChanged()` both listen to it and flush their
 * caches (13.4: SiteConfiguration.php:301, SiteFinder.php:117; 14.3:
 * SiteConfiguration.php:322, SiteFinder.php:117). Going through `SiteWriter`
 * is what makes a freshly written configuration visible to `SiteFinder` in the
 * same PHP process - which the seeding run itself needs, see
 * {@see self::findUncoveredSiteRoots()}.
 *
 * ## What a template is
 *
 * A directory holding a `config.yaml` and optionally a `settings.yaml`, which
 * is exactly the shape of a site below the instance's `config/sites/`. A
 * template can therefore be produced by copying a working site out of an
 * instance, and it is read with the loader TYPO3 reads its own site
 * configurations with.
 *
 * What a **minimal** `config.yaml` needs is one key: `rootPageId`, and it is
 * the one key this class overwrites anyway. Everything else has a fallback -
 * `SiteConfiguration::resolveAllExistingSites()` skips a configuration whose
 * `rootPageId` is not greater than zero **without a word**, and
 * `Site::__construct()` substitutes a default `languages` entry and an empty
 * `base` for what is missing. Both are byte identical on 13.4 and 14.3 (the
 * only difference between the two `Site` classes is a `@todo` comment), so a
 * template that works on one version works on the other. A useful template
 * declares `base` and `languages`, because the defaults are a site on `/` in
 * "Default / en_US.UTF-8".
 *
 * `settings.yaml` holds the site settings - the values `SiteSettingsFactory`
 * reads for `Site::getSettings()`, which is where the site-local overrides of
 * site set settings are persisted (`SiteSettingsService` on both versions
 * calls that file "our persistence target"). It is separate from `config.yaml`
 * because the backend writes it separately, and it is copied verbatim when the
 * template ships one.
 *
 * `dependencies:` - the site sets a site pulls in - is **not** a v14 only key
 * and needs no version handling: `Site::__construct()` reads
 * `$configuration['dependencies'] ?? []` into `$this->sets` on 13.4 and 14.3
 * alike. What v14.3 adds is a fourth `array $dependencies = []` argument to
 * `SiteWriter::createNewBasicSite()`, which this class does not call, and
 * route enhancers resolved from sets in `SiteConfiguration`. A template
 * carrying `dependencies:` is therefore written unchanged on both versions and
 * understood on both - asserted by a functional test rather than assumed, so
 * that a version which starts rejecting the key is found here.
 *
 * There is consequently **no version difference to apply to the finished
 * array**. Where one turns up it belongs right before the `write()` call, with
 * a `@todo` naming the condition under which it goes away, because
 * configuration is the documented exception to the "split the class" rule.
 *
 * ## An identifier that already exists is refused
 *
 * `SiteWriter::write()` **merges**: when `config.yaml` already exists it loads
 * the unprocessed file, diffs the incoming configuration against the processed
 * one and applies only the modified and removed keys with
 * `ArrayUtility::mergeRecursiveWithOverrule()`. It is built for the backend
 * site module, where the file is the source of truth and the form supplies
 * changes. Seeding a set into an instance that already has a site of that
 * identifier would therefore produce neither the template nor the previous
 * configuration but a silent hybrid of both, so this class refuses instead.
 * `SiteWriter::delete()` is not the answer either - it unlinks `config.yaml`
 * and leaves the directory and its `settings.yaml` behind, and deleting an
 * instance's hand-maintained site configuration is not a seeder's decision to
 * make.
 *
 * ## Where templates may live
 *
 * `YamlFileLoader` resolves through `GeneralUtility::getFileAbsFileName()`,
 * which refuses a path outside `Environment::getProjectPath()` and
 * `Environment::getPublicPath()`. A template therefore has to sit inside the
 * project, which every package of an installation does, and which is the same
 * constraint the seed definition itself is already read under
 * ({@see \SBUERK\DataFactory\Seeding\Parser\SeedDefinitionParser::parseFile()}).
 *
 * @internal Part of the seeding implementation, not public API.
